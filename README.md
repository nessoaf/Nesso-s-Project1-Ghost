MAZE Escape

Drat you’ve found yourself into the depths of a dungeon where the only way is forward or left.. or right?
It’s your job to evacuate from this maze while keeping your head. while the entrance seems clear there might be something more sinister lurking in the darkness
“Once you’ve gotten your bearing beware of traps?” maybe idk probably later in the process.


## Mvp:
* Npcs that travel around the map - completed
* Block formats - completed
* Character functionality – movement - compeletd
* Collisions with walls - completed
* Endgame scenario
    * Game Ends with a death (character runs into enemie obj)
        * Restart scenario/or more of a reset ( once game ends - doesnt require outside game refresh)
            * restarts the game from scratch(possible page reload)
* combat/hit - completed

## Stretch:
* Have mazes that are more open/less one way out only
* Add character/npc art
* Add traps/pitfalls/someway to change the map
* Maybe make a boss room that has collisions that effect the boss – like raid mechanics
* Possible win state – after boss room 1 or 5
* add damage
* npcsmaybe try to follow the player?
